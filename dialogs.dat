Good morning, my grandchild.


I think you are finally old enough;
it is time you take up your
grandfather's sword!
Alas, it is no simple task to claim
such a powerful weapon.  It is
stored away in the attic -
the door to which is bounded by
four locks.

And as you know, the attic is also
overrun with a great monster.
You must defeat this devilry to
claim the sword.


Oh, and by the way... the four keys
to open the locks to the attic
reside seperately, one in each
of the four rooms you see
before you.

May the fates smile upon you, my
grandchild!  This quest will be your
coming of age before you go out
into the vast world beyond this
small cottage.
